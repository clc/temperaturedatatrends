The Temperature Data Trends application enables you to record and keep track of
your temperature readings and your wellness status (“feeling well” or
“feeling sick”) by date and time.  By default, this information is stored
locally on your device.

For doctors, you can create your own form and send your patients an activation
link. Once they click on this link and accept that they will be uploading their
temperature to you, when they take their temperature, it will also show up in
your form. There are visualization tools to help you make sense of this data.
